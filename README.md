This is the Thundy Games tutorial for Development with Ren'Py. As this game gets more complicated, we will make a number of changes to keep up with the tutorial. However, if you want to start the series, you can find it here: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKdE0Vv4UA5-dqJLpDkPt5CLQzc6hJ-uh

So far, this is what we have done:
# Created the initial game environment in Ren'Py
# Connected the Ren'Py language package to the Atom.io Text Editor
# Created a new character for use in the dialogue
# Changed the text coloration for the speaker so that we can see the color to identify the speaker without reading their name
# Created our first choice menu to allow the game to branch between a Good Day and a Bad Day.
# Created a third menu choice to continue the Good Day using the jump and call commands
# Added an image for the character Eileen
# Change the picture of Eileen based on whether you have had a good or bad day
# Worked with Scenes to make the images of Eileen disappear (this did not seem to work but the command is still there)
# Experimented with an image click command to change the picture of Eileen when someone clicks the mouse (now commented out as it was for illustrative purposes and nothing more)
# Created variables to store the Player's Score and the Player's name
# Used variable changes to modify the name of the character (now commented out as it was for illustrative purposes)
# Included text that shows the values of Player Name and Score
# Used variable changes to increase or decrease the score of the player based on whether they had a good or bad day.

We are now about to begin lesson 6.
