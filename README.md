This is the Thundy Games tutorial for Development with Ren'Py. As this game gets more complicated, we will make a number of changes to keep up with the tutorial. However, if you want to start the series, you can find it here: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKdE0Vv4UA5-dqJLpDkPt5CLQzc6hJ-uh

## So far, this is what we have done:
1. Created the initial game environment in Ren'Py
2. Connected the Ren'Py language package to the Atom.io Text Editor
3. Created a new character for use in the dialogue
4. Changed the text coloration for the speaker so that we can see the color to identify the speaker without reading their name
5. Created our first choice menu to allow the game to branch between a Good Day and a Bad Day.
6. Created a third menu choice to continue the Good Day using the jump and call commands
7. Added an image for the character Eileen
8. Change the picture of Eileen based on whether you have had a good or bad day
9. Worked with Scenes to make the images of Eileen disappear (this did not seem to work but the command is still there)
10. Experimented with an image click command to change the picture of Eileen when someone clicks the mouse (now commented out as it was for illustrative purposes and nothing more)
11. Created variables to store the Player's Score and the Player's name
12. Used variable changes to modify the name of the character (now commented out as it was for illustrative purposes)
13. Included text that shows the values of Player Name and Score
14. Used variable changes to increase or decrease the score of the player based on whether they had a good or bad day.

## We are now about to begin lesson 6.
